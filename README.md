Created a fully functioning DDL script that the could be run to create a demo of the Hotel Reservation System database by inserting values and creating sequences. Script includes specifications of data types, lengths, constraints, indices.

## 3. Database Querying
Basic select statements to query customer's demgraphic information, reservations, and payment information to help identify valuable customers and hotel's performances.

Select statements to extract insights such as understanding how popular the hotel is based on where customers are from, how many times each customer has stayed in a particular room at the South Austin location, or the anticipated number of guests by location and check_in_date.
